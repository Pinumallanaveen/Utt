This repo demonstrates how a simple benchmark (written in Golang and built into Docker container) works against your HTTP server. More details are described in our [6 recent cases from our SRE workaday routine](https://blog.flant.com/troubleshooting-web-apps-issues-6-recent-cases-from-our-sres/) article (case #1).
